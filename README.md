#Bootstrap UI Kit
*A UI Kit based on the Twitter Bootstrap framework of website styles and UI components*

##Why the UI Kit?
This was created because sometimes it's faster to take your sketch and create a mockup in a mockup tool.  Ideally you can go from sketch to html/css prototype but some are slow at coding or are still learning how to code. The PSD file layers use CSS styling elements to help move you from PSD to CSS faster and sooner.

##Requirements
Photoshop 5.1 or later is required for PSD due to nested layers.
